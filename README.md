Designed and implemented a multi-class architecture using OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and modularity (e.g., StudentDashboard, AdminDashboard, CourseAdd, EditProfileQuery).

Developed and connected a relational MySQL database with 7+ tables (student, course, teacher, result, etc.) to manage structured academic data.

Implemented role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student), enabling personalized dashboards and CRUD operations.

Utilized SQL queries for inserting, updating, and retrieving user/course information and generating dynamic reports.

Logged user activities (login times, user types) into a dedicated table (activity) for auditing and analysis â€” aligned with ETL/log ingestion practices.

Applied MVC-like design: Separate GUI components (Java Swing), data handlers, and service logic for maintainability and scalability.
